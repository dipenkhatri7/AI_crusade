    "z =\"\"\"h my God, we're off the first round of this Grand Final, so much anticipation, and we get to watch that's a lot of nades in the sky, still no one spotted first Contact. Smoke's actually into the pit, sdy is blind as well, he needs to repositioned. He's not allowed to, a quick flick from twist, and he's not done, one more to fight on the side, and it's twists again, arrives in style for the Face Clan. Plan the site occupied, Bets already making a case for the retake. Util here, armor on Perfecto, 2v3, and Karagoon dancing dies. Victim dancing around the site, time ticking, it's only Bit, he doesn't have the help for this, he'd need to Queen-click shots, it's not to be, you can see what it means to him. Wants to start strong, first pistol probably thought about that. Oh, Rain, how aware is the Norwegian today? Hello and goodbye, successful from this dastardly Duo. Simple's got two on the people, three potentially down the lane from Robs again, he rights the ship just as things looked a little hectic. Like it's not, there's no denying Navi really have had two opportunities in two rounds to immediately post that first CT round. And we're already getting a bit of violence against the chickens here, two, and then this nade look, they're getting the AK. About to double swing, Robs just puts it right on the money. And talking to money, that's going to do wonders for Navi. Look what they've managed to bring through, there's a couple of pistols initially, but leaving with an 8K, a Galil, and likely a good intention for their first defensive round. Kit still, Carrigan's called a good game here and asking questions early. Broke loses the battle head to head, and Carrick is still there should be dead, jumping hoping and down to the simple orb. Two on its first presence in the server, Mort could be found. I'm not sure if they saw sdy up on the Boost, I don't know if he can test it, or if it was even spotted, but it has sent them back searching towards B. Smoke there, what is Perfecto gonna do with this? Does he want to gamble towards the A site, or does he believe there's a little bit more behind it because the bomb on Rain is making its way into the site. Robs is just containing this, and this has to be perfect if you really want to go, you go on the flash, Twist at's Vision counter nade strong slows him. Cuts Perfecto down in half, and that's another one for Twist. Alive now and a kick in. Nice France out of vents to get on it. Only needs to stop it. I don't think there's time, there's no time for this at all. Props a headshot as well for good measure. Wow, Navi, they put everything into that, lying and wait. This'll be a great call here, safe from the Flash's electronic. You may have to do a lot here, sdy has already revealed himself into the side. So Carrigan on the mid fight and another back and forth, they are into the side though. Simple, what does he wait for the rotate because that bomb is going down, surely they save this son right? I know it's a three-on-three situation here but again locked out. That's that posturing for it still. I've got kids, they've got a bit of util for this, smoke, molly, they can use one of those over towards the people. You need to get boss Carrick and the Flash Forward, Carrigan steps out, nobody blind. Carrigan's down, a big catch, jumps into their jaws, this retakes on Twist and Rain now have to partner up. Crossfire established, a great headshot, Tim heads his twists, only one and traded. Keep this up, as always make sure to check out hot pizza GG, the best website to open cases and not only recently they've added the old but gold classic mode where many players add their skins and The Winner Takes it all. The catch is the more you add the bigger chances of winning you have here. For example, I bet my gut knife black laminate for 108, which gave me 30 chances of winning the round, and luckily I won and took all the bank of 354 dollars. While drawing skins is super easy, just go to your inventory and select the Skins you want to withdraw, and in less than a minute, you'll receive a trade offer. So if you want to play, Hot Pizza has many different payment methods as well as a cool bonus from me. Use code a lot apart to get 50 cents for free. Link will be in description below. Oh spotted, space starting to choke them out. It's Simple though who does give us something to talk about, another.\"\"\""
